# Getting Started with Myria
There are three ways you can quickly get started using Myria. We describe each method below.

#### Using the Myria Demo Service
The UW Database Group hosts a demonstration Myria service: <http://demo.myria.cs.washington.edu>.
We highly recommend this option for new Myria users to get a sense of what Myria is about. 
The demo service runs on Amazon EC2 with four instances, so it is not capable to do any heavy works. 

#### Launching your own Myria Amazon Cluster (EC2)
For real data analysis, we recommend launching your own Amazon cluster. Instructions are [here](myria-ec2).

#### Launching a Local Installation of Myria
If you're interested in running a local version of Myria on your own personal machine (primarily for those interested in Myria development), instructions are [here](myriax/).

## How to Use Myria
There are two ways to interact with Myria through the browser: <br>
1. [Myria-Web](myria-web-page). <br>
2. [Jupyter/IPython Notebook](myria-python). 

If you are using the Myria Demo Service, you can access Myria-Web [here](http://demo.myria.cs.washington.edu) and the Jupyter/IPyton Notebook [here]().

If you launch your own Myria Amazon cluster, an instance of Myria-Web and Jupyter/IPython Notebook are created automatically for you. If the deployment is successful, you will be provided with links to each of these options.
